Each LLM can be your assistant that trained on your code (your mind, company software development strategy).

developer is not writing code that GenAI can help for all of them

in 5 years: 
syntax is not important, software developer can be in higher and higher levels


- Introduction to GenAI:
generate new content
to enhance youe efficiency
you dont need only code to system works


- Pair Coding with LLms:
analyze the codes
update dependencies and conflics
writing documents
dealing with technical debt

the domain knowledge of the languafe and libraries also the domain knowledge make us better developer and prompter.
for example we can ask chatgpt to make a function to add two numbers but when we tell him to use numpy it different.
be specific and clear language

use context in the prompt

intertivly try to improve your code for example main function then ask for error jandling and then ask for commect and documentation

assign role:
basic: explain to to create a list python
with role: As a beginner python tutor, explain to create list in python

multiple roles:
As both software archotect and a security expert ....

Expert roles:
llms can be one of your developers
As a NLP expert, ...
As a professioal IELTS speaking tutor, ...
As a software tester, ...


LLMs best practice:
be specific: detail and context (maybe a large prompt)
assign a role:
request an expert opinion:
get feedback:

getting the motst out of LLMs:
expriment with what your llm can do
test llm code carefully
use llms as a learning tool
be a context expert

- Leveraging an LLM for code analysis
